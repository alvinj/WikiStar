WikiStar
========

_WikiStar_ is an editor that occasionally translates wiki markup and LaTeX markup to HTML correctly.

You really don't want to look in this project; the code is very old, and poorly organized. (I wrote it
in a rush when I had very little free time, as I was busy running a company.)
