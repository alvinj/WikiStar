<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Counters</h1>
<p>
 Everything LaTeX numbers for you has a counter associated with it. The
 name  of the counter  is the same  as the name  of the environment  or
 command that produces  the number,  except with no <tt>\.</tt>  Below is a list
 of some of the counters  used in  LaTeX's  standard  document  styles  to control
 numbering.
<pre>
 part            paragraph       figure          enumi
 chapter         subparagraph    table           enumii
 section         page            footnote        enumiii
 subsection      equation        mpfootnote      enumiv
 subsubsection

<h2>Manipulating the way counters are printed</h2>
Counters are printed in LaTeX by using a command generated as
"<tt>\the</tt>" suffixed with the name of the counter.  Thus, equation
numbers are printed by the <tt>\theequation</tt> command, and
section numbers by the <tt>\thesection</tt> command.
If you want to change the way such numbers are printed, for example, 
change from arabic to Roman numerals, you need to redefine the 
appropriate command, using the 
<tt><a href="ltx-18.html">\renewcommand</a></tt> command.
<p>
As an example, to number equations in an appendix as <tt>A-1</tt>, 
<tt>A-2</tt>, ... , use <pre>
  <tt>\renewcommand{\theequation}{A-<a href="ltx-201.html">\arabic</a>{equation}}</tt></pre>
The second argument implies that the text produced by the renewed 
<tt>\theequation</tt> command will be "A-" followed by the output from 
the <tt>\arabic{equation}</tt> command, which is the value of the 
equation counter, printed as an arabic number.
<p>
In <a href="lists.html">List Environments</a> the format for the 
item labels is given by commands like <tt>\labelitemi</tt> and 
<tt>\labelitemii</tt> (for the first two levels of the 
<a href="ltx-250.html">Itemize Environment</a>), and like <tt>\labelenumi</tt>
(for the <a href="ltx-222.html">Enumerate Environment</a>), and these may 
also be redefined.
<p>
There is an <a href="ltx-260.html#example">example</a> of manipulating such 
counters in the discussion of the List Environment.
See also the discussions in the <a href="ltx-250.html">Itemize Environment</a>
and in the <a href="ltx-222.html#example">Enumerate Environment</a>.
<p>
You can force a change in the number produced by any of the counters.  For
example, if you wanted to produce a single page numbered 13, you could use
<pre>
  <tt><a href="ltx-310.html">\setcounter</a>{page}{13}</tt></pre>
A variety of commands for manipulating counters this way are given below.
