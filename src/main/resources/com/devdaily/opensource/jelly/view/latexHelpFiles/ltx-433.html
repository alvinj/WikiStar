<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Quotation Marks</h1>
LaTeX distinguishes between left (<tt>`</tt>) and right (<tt>'</tt>) 
quotation marks; the former corresponds to the "grave" generally found
to the left of the numbers at top of the keyboard, and the latter 
corresponds to the usual single quote mark.
<p>
These symbols, by themselves, produce left and right single quotes.
<p>
Double quote are produced by typing two in a row: <tt>``text''</tt>.
<p>
To separate consecutive single and double quotes, use a 
<a href="ltx-185.html"><tt>\,</tt></a>.
