<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\address</h1>
<tt>\address{Return address}</tt>
<p>
 The  return  address,  as it should  appear  on the  letter  and  the
 envelope.   Separate  lines of the address should be separated  by 
<a href="ltx-181.html"><tt>\\</tt></a> 
 commands.   If you do not  make  an <tt>\address</tt>  declaration,  then  the
 letter  will  be  formatted  for  copying  onto  your  organization's
 standard letterhead.   If you give an <tt>\address</tt> declaration,  then the
 letter will be formatted as a personal letter.
