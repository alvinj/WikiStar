<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Input to LaTeX</h1>
Input to LaTeX is plain text (ascii) which includes both the text of the
document and also formatting commands.  It is possible to 
<a href="ltx-165.html">split the input</a> into several files using:
<ul>
<li><a href="ltx-245.html"><tt>\include</tt></a>
<li><a href="ltx-248.html"><tt>\input</tt></a>
</ul>
<p>
Space characters separate words.  Two space characters in a row are 
equivalent to a single space character.  The end of line is also 
equivalent to a space character.  (However, a percent sign, 
<a href="ltx-434.html"><tt>%</tt></a>, can end a line without
generating a space character.)  Generally, space characters at the beginning
of a line are ignored.
<p>
An empty or blank line between two lines of text defines 
<a href="ltx-111.html">a new paragraph</a>.
Two blank lines are equivalent to one.
<h2>Special Characters</h2>
The following ten characters are <a href="ltx-164.html">Special LaTeX 
Characters</a>: 
<pre><tt>  $ & % # _ { } ~ ^ \ </tt>
</pre>
If entered directly in the input they cause LaTeX to do something special. 
You can get the following seven of them into your document by simply 
preceding them with a backslash (<tt>\</tt>):
<pre><tt>      $ & % # _ { }  </tt>
</pre>  
To get the other three (<tt> ~ ^ \ </tt>) in 
your output requires <a href="ltx-164.html">more work</a>.

<h2>LaTex Commands</h2>
Commands take one of two forms
<ul><li>a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) followed by a single special character
    <li>a bacslash (<tt>\</tt>) followed by a string of letters
</ul>
The second case is case-sensitive; 
<a href="ltx-405.html"><tt>\Gamma</tt></a> is different from 
<a href="ltx-405.html"><tt>\gamma</tt></a>.
These commands are terminated by a nonletter, i.e., a blank, a number,
a punctuation mark or special character. 
<p>
Commands may have mandatory arguments, which are input in braces 
(<tt>{}</tt>).
They may also have optional arguments, which are input in square brackets
(<tt>[]</tt>).
<p>
For commands which produce text a trailing blank may be interpreted as the
end of the command, which does not automatically create a space, so
 you may have to do something to create an
<a href="ltx-431.html">interword space</a> after this text.

<h2><a name="structure">Structure of Input</a></h2>
LaTeX input normally begins with a 
<a href="ltx-22.html"><tt>\documentstyle</tt></a> command.  (In LaTeX2e
this is replaced with a <a href="versions.html"><tt>\documentclass</tt></a>
command.)
<p>
The beginning of the document text follows a <tt>\begin{document}</tt>
command.
<p>
Input between the <tt>\documentstyle</tt> and <tt>\begin{document}</tt>
is called the <em>preamble</em> and typically contains <a href="ltx-17.html">new
command definitions</a>, information for the 
<a href="ltx-263.html">title</a>, <a href="declarations.html">declarations</a>
which affect things like <a href="ltx-176.html">Typefaces</a>, etc.
<p>
The document text (and generally also the LaTeX input) is terminated by a 
<tt>\end{document}</tt> command.
<p>
It is possible to obtain some of the input from <a href="ltx-165.html">external
files</a>, i.e., those which are not the main file input to the LaTeX program.
