<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Dashes</h1>
LaTeX provides for three sizes of dashes which are indicated by 
typing one, two, or three consecutive dashes in the text.
<ul>
<li>a hyphenation dash, as in X-ray, is a single dash
<li>a dash between limits, as in 1--2, is a double dash
<li>a parenthetical punctuation --- such as this --- is a triple dash
</ul>
Note that this applies to paragraph mode.  In math mode each <tt>-</tt>
is interpreted as a minus sign.
