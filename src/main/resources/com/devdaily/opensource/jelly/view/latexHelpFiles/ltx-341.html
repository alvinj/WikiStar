<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\vector</h1>
<p>
 <tt>\vector(x-slope,y-slope){length}</tt>
<p>
 The <tt>\vector</tt> command draws an arrow of the specified length and slope
 with the arrow head at the opposite end of the line from the 
 reference point (see <a href="ltx-296.html"><tt>\put</tt></a>).
<p>
The slope is determined by <tt>(x-slope,y-slope)</tt> which are signed
integers of magnitude less than or equal to 4 and which have no common
divisor except for plus or minus one; For example (1,0) is a horizontal
arrow pointing right; (1,1) gives a slope of
45 degress; (0,1) is a vertical arrow pointing up; (-1,1) is at 135 degrees.
<p>
The <strong>horizontal</strong> extent of the arrow is given by the  
<tt>length</tt> parameter, except in the case of a vertical arrow in 
which case <tt>length</tt> specifies the vertical height.
