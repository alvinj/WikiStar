 <tt> \markright{right head}</tt>
<p>

 The <tt>\markboth</tt> and <tt>\markright</tt>
 commands are used in conjunction with the
 page  style  myheadings  for setting  either  both  or just  the right
 heading.  In addition to their use with the myheadings page style, you
 can use them to override  the normal headings  in the headings  style,
 since LaTeX uses these  same commands  to generate  those  heads.  You
 should  note  that  a left-hand  heading  is  generated  by  the  last
 <tt>\markboth</tt>  command  before  the end of the  page,  while  a right-hand
 heading is generated by the first <tt>\markboth</tt>  or <tt>\markright</tt>
 that comes
 on the page if there  is one,  otherwise  by the last  one before  the
 page.
