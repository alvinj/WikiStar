<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\hline</h1>
 The <tt>\hline</tt> command will draw a horizontal line the width of the table. 
 It's most commonly used to draw a line at the top, bottom, and between
 the rows of the table.
<p>
 Two successive <tt>\hline</tt> commands leave a space between the 
 lines; this space does <strong>not</strong> contain the vertical lines
 specified by <tt>|</tt> characters in the <tt>col</tt> argument of the
 <a href="ltx-68.html"><tt>\begin{tabular}{col}</tt></a> command.
<p>
 To place a line at the bottom of a table, the <tt>\hline</tt> command
 must follow a <a href="ltx-181.html"><tt>\\</tt></a> (line break) command
 after the last table entry.  This final line break command should be 
 present <strong>only</strong> in this circumstance.
