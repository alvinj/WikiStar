 <tt>\addvspace{length}</tt>
<p>

 The  <tt>\addvspace</tt>  command  normally  adds  a vertical  space  of height
 <tt>length</tt>.  
 However, if vertical space has already been added to the same
 point  in the  output  by a previous  <tt>\addvspace</tt>  command,  then  this
 command will not add more space than needed to make the natural length
 of the total vertical space equal to length.
