<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3>
<h1>Downloading the Complete Help Files</h1>

<p>If you find Hypertext Help with LaTeX to be useful, you are welcome to 
obtain the complete set of files and install them on your own machine.
Retrieval and installation instructions are given below.
They may be installed for use either with a webserver, which 
will ease network traffic and probably give you faster access,
or they may be installed as local files which may be "read" 
with an HTML viewer, such as Lynx, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Opera, etc.  
without the necessity of a network connection.</p>

<p>To facilitate off-network usage, 
the files generally have only local (within the same directory) hypertext 
links. All links to "external" URLs, including much LaTeX information 
available on the Web, have been restricted to one file in this set other than
the current one.</p>

<p>Although it is not required, if you make these files available on a public
webserver, please send a note to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@giss.nasa.gov">webmaster@giss.nasa.gov</a>
if you would like it to be including among the
<a href="mirror.html">mirror sites</a>.</p>

<p>The files are available via anonymous ftp as a
<a href="ftp://ftp.giss.nasa.gov/pub/sgreen/latex/latex.tar.gz">gzipped
tar-red archive</a> (about 80 kb). 
Your web browser can download the archive, after which you can use
any one of many shareware compression programs to extract all the
files within. We've found recent versions of
<a href="http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/">StuffIt Expander</a>
useful in this regard.</p>

<p>Alternatively, for those of you logged into a Unix shell acount,
you can retrieve the archive
by anonymous ftp to <kbd>ftp.giss.nasa.gov</kbd>.
Login as anonymous and give your e-mail address as the password,
then switch to binary mode and download the file by issuing the 
commands:</p>

<pre>
  bin
  cd pub/sgreen/latex
  get latex.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>After downloading the file on your local machine, issue the
Unix commands:</p>

<pre>
   gunzip latex.tar.gz
   tar -xf latex.tar
</pre>


<p>This will create a subdirectory named
<kbd>latex</kbd> in your current directory which contains the complete
set of html files and which requires about 1 MByte of disk space.</p>

<p>(Note: some web browsers will automatically gunzip the file after
retrieval, but you will still need to manually extract files from the
archive.)</p>

<p>You may rename or move the entire <kbd>latex</kbd> subdirectory
as desired; all file references are local to the directory so links
should continue to work.
The "Introduction" file is <kbd>index.html</kbd> and the Table of
Contents page is <kbd>ltx-2.html</kbd>. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="index.html">Back to the Introduction</a>
  <li><a href="ltx-2.html">On to the Table of Contents</a>
</ul>
