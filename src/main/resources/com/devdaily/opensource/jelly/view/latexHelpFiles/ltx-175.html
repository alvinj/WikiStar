<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\typein</h1>
 <tt>\typein[cmd]{msg}</tt>
<p>
 Prints <tt>msg</tt> on the terminal  and causes  LaTeX to stop and wait for you
 to type a line of input, ending with return.   If the <tt>cmd</tt> argument  is
 missing,  the typed input is processed  as if it had been included  in
 the input file in place of the <tt>\typein</tt>  command.   If the <tt>cmd</tt> 
 argument is present,  it must be a command  name.   This command  name  is then
 defined or redefined to be the typed input.
