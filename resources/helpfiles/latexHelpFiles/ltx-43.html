 The picture  environment  allows you to create  just about any kind of
 picture you want containing text, lines, arrows and circles.  You tell
 LaTeX  where  to  put  things  in  the  picture  by  specifying  their
 coordinates.   A coordinate  is a number that may have a decimal point
 and a minus sign  (<tt>-</tt>), for example,  5, 2.3, or -3.1416.   A coordinate
 specifies a length in multiples of the unit length 
 <a href="unitlength.html"><tt>\unitlength</tt></a>,  so if
 <tt>\unitlength</tt>  has been set to 1cm, then the coordinate 2.54 specifies a
 length of 2.54 centimeters.   You can change  the value of <tt>\unitlength</tt>
 anywhere  you want, using the 
 <a href="ltx-88.html"><tt>\setlength</tt></a>  command,  
 but it should be set before the beginning of the picture environment since
 strange things may happen if you try changing it inside the picture environment.
<p>
 A position is a pair of coordinates,  such as (2.4,-5), specifying the
 point  with x-coordinate = 2.4 and y-coordinate = -5.   Coordinates  are
 specified  in the  usual  way  with  respect  to an origin,  which  is
 normally  at the lower-left  corner of the picture.   Note that when a
 position  appears as an argument,  it is not enclosed  in braces;  the
 parentheses serve to delimit the argument.
<p>
 The  picture  environment  has  one  mandatory  argument,  which 
 specifies  the size  of the picture.   The  environment
 produces  a rectangular  box with width and height determined  by this
 argument's two values.
<p>
 The  picture  environment  also  has  an optional  position  argument,
 following  the size argument,  that  can change  the origin.   (Unlike
 ordinary optional arguments,  this argument is not contained in square
 brackets.) The optional argument gives the coordinates of the point at
 the lower-left corner of the picture (thereby determining the origin). 
 For example, if 
 <a href="unitlength.html"><tt>\unitlength</tt></a> has been set to 1mm, 
 the command
<p>
<p><pre>
 \begin{picture}(100,200)(10,20)
</pre>
 produces   a  picture   of  width  100  millimeters   and  height  200
 millimeters,  whose lower-left  corner is the point (10,20)  and whose
 upper-right  corner is therefore the point (110,220).   
 Typically one initially omits the optional  argument,  leaving  the
 origin  at the lower-left  corner.   If you then want  to modify  your
 picture by shifting everything, you just add the appropriate  optional
 argument.
<p>
 The environment's  mandatory  argument determines  the nominal size of
 the picture.   This need  bear  no relation  to how large  the picture
 really  is; LaTeX will happily  allow  you to put things  outside  the
 picture, or even off the page.  The picture's  nominal size is used by
 TeX in determining how much room to leave for it.
<p>
 Everything that appears in a picture is drawn by the 
 <a href="ltx-296.html"><tt>\put</tt></a> command. The
 command
<pre>
 \put (11.3,-.3){obj}
</pre>
 puts the object specified  by <tt>obj</tt> in the picture, with its reference
 point at coordinates  (11.3,-.3).   The reference  points  for various
 objects will be described below.
<p>
 The <a href="ltx-296.html"><tt>\put</tt></a> 
 command creates an LR box.  You can put anything  in the text
 argument  of the <tt>\put</tt> command  that you'd put into the argument  
 of an <a href="ltx-265.html"><tt>\mbox</tt></a> 
 (or related)  command.   When you do this,  the reference  point
 will be the lower left corner of the box.
