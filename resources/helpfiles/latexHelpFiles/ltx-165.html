<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Splitting the Input</h1>
 A large document  requires  a lot of input.   Rather than putting  the
 whole input in a single  large file, it's more efficient  to split  it
 into several smaller ones.  Regardless  of how many separate files you
 use, there is one that is the root file; it is the one whose  name you
 type when you run LaTeX.
