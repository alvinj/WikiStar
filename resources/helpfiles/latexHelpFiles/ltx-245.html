 <tt>\include{file}</tt>
<p>
 The <tt>\include</tt>  command  is used  in conjunction  with  the 
 <tt><a href="ltx-246.html">\includeonly</a></tt>
 command for selective  inclusion  of files.  The <tt>file</tt> argument  is the
 first  name of a file,  denoting  <tt>file.tex</tt>.   If the file is also
 in the file list of the <tt>\includeonly</tt>  command  or if there is no
 <tt>\includeonly</tt> command, the <tt>\include</tt> command is equivalent to
<Pre>
  <tt><a href="ltx-213.html">\clearpage</a> \input{file} <a href="ltx-213.html">\clearpage</a></tt>
</Pre>
 except  that  if the file <tt>file.tex</tt>  does  not exist,  then  a warning
 message  rather than an error is produced.   If the file is not in the
 file list, the <tt>\include</tt> command is equivalent to <tt>\clearpage</tt>.
<p>
 The <tt>\include</tt> command may not appear in the preamble  or in a file read
 by another <tt>\include</tt> command.
