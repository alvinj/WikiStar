<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\cline</h1>
 <tt>\cline{i-j}</tt>
<p>
 The  <tt>\cline</tt>  command   draws  horizontal   lines  across  the  columns
 specified,  beginning  in column i and ending  in column  j, which are
 identified in the mandatory argument.
<p>
It is used in the  <A href="ltx-68.html">tabular</A> and
<a href="ltx-202.html">array</a> environment.
<p>
 Two (or more) successive <tt>\cline</tt> commands draw lines in the same
 vertical position.  Typically, <tt>\cline</tt> commands are placed after a 
 <a href="ltx-181.html"><tt>\\</tt></a> (line breadk) command so that 
 they separate items on two lines; they do
 not, however, need a line break command afterwards.
