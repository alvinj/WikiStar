<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>Arrays</h1>
<p>
<p><pre>
 \begin{array}[pos]{vvvv}
 column 1 entry &amp: column 2 entry ... &amp; column n entry \\
 ...
 ...
 ...
 \end{array}
</pre><p>
 The array environment, like the <a href="ltx-68.html">tabular</a> 
 environment, produces a <a href="ltx-143.html">box</a> 
 consisting of a sequence of rows of
 vertically aligned columns. It can be used only within the 
 <a href="ltx-115.html">math environment</a>.
<p>
 There is a single mandatory argument describing  the number of columns and 
 the alignment within each of them. 
 Each of the <tt>v</tt>'s in the argument specifies a column and may be
 a <tt>l</tt>, <tt>c</tt>, or <tt>r</tt> indicating that the column should
 be flush left, centered, or flush right, respectively. For more
 complex options, see the <a href="ltx-68.html">tabular environment</a>
 which uses the same format.
<p>
 The optional <tt>pos</tt> argument specifies the alignment of the array with 
 its surrounding environment (recall that LaTeX treats boxes as one,  
 albeit large letter).  The options are
<ul>
<li><tt>t</tt> - align on top row
<li><tt>b</tt> - align on bottom row
</ul>
The default is to align on the center of the array.
<p>
 Column entries must be separated  by an <tt>&amp;</tt>.  Column entries 
 may include other LaTeX commands, even other arrays.   
 Each row of the array must be terminated  with
 the string  <a href="ltx-181.html"><tt>\\</tt></a>. 
 Note that there is no <tt>&amp;</tt> after the last
 item in a row and no <tt>\\</tt> after the last row.  (An exception is if
 an <tt><a href="ltx-239.html">\hline</a></tt> is used to place a line
 at the bottom; it follows a <tt>\\</tt>.)
<p>
Each item in the array is treated as if it were surrounded by braces. Thus,
a <a href="declarations.html">declaration</a> within an array item is
local to that item, i.e., it is ended by an <tt>&amp;</tt> or <tt>\\</tt>.
<p>
Horizontal and vertical lines in the array are produced with
<ul>
<li><a href="ltx-214.html"><tt>\cline</tt></a>
<li><a href="ltx-239.html"><tt>\hline</tt></a>
<li><a href="ltx-346.html"><tt>\vline</tt></a>
</ul>
