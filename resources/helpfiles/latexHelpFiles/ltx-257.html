<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\line</h1>
<p>
 <tt>\line(x-slope,y-slope){length}</tt>
<p>
 The <tt>\line</tt> command draws a line of the specified length and slope.
<p>
The slope is determined by <tt>(x-slope,y-slope)</tt> which are signed
integers of magnitude less than or equal to 6 and which have no common
divisor except for plus or minus one; For example (1,0) is a horizontal
line; (1,1) gives a slope of
45 degress; (0,1) is a vertical line; (-1,1) is 135 degrees.
<p>
The <strong>horizontal</strong> extent of the line is given by the  
<tt>length</tt> parameter, except in the case of a vertical line in 
which case <tt>length</tt> specifies the vertical height.
