<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>LaTex Commands</h1>

<p>Commands take one of two forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) followed by a single special character
  <li>a backslash (<tt>\</tt>) followed by a string of letters
</ul>

<p>The second case is case-sensitive; 
<a href="ltx-405.html"><tt>\Gamma</tt></a> is different from 
<a href="ltx-405.html"><tt>\gamma</tt></a>.
These commands are terminated by a nonletter, i.e., a blank, a number,
a punctuation mark or special character. </p>

<p>For commands which produce text a trailing blank is interpreted as the
end of the command, which does not automatically create a space, so
you may have to do something to create an
<a href="ltx-431.html">interword space</a> after this text.</p>

<p>Commands may have mandatory arguments, which are input in braces 
(<tt>{}</tt>).
They may also have optional arguments, which are input in square brackets
(<tt>[]</tt>).</p>

<H2>Defining new commands, etc.</H2>

<p>See: </p>

<ul>
<li><A href="ltx-18.html"><tt>\newcommand</tt></A>
<li><A href="ltx-19.html"><tt>\newenvironment</tt></A>
<li><A href="ltx-20.html"><tt>\newtheorem</tt></A>
<li><A href="ltx-21.html"><tt>\newfont</tt></A>
</ul>
These must be used for entities which are not already defined.  To 
redefine something use, for example,
<A href="ltx-18.html"><tt>\renewcommand</tt></A>.
