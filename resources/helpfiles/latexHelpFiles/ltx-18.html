<h1>\newcommand \renewcommand</h1>
<p>
 <tt>\newcommand{cmd}[args][opt]{def}</tt>
<br>
 <tt>\renewcommand{cmd}[args][opt]{def}</tt>
<br>
 <tt>\providecommand{cmd}[args][opt]{def}</tt> -- 
         <a href="versions.html">LaTeX2e</a></p>

<p>
 These commands define (or redefine) a command.</p>

<ul>
<li><TT>cmd</TT> The name of the new or redefined command.
     A <tt>\</tt> followed by a string of lower and/or uppercase 
     letters or a <tt>\</tt> followed by a single nonletter.
     For <tt>\newcommand</tt> the name  must
     not  be  already  defined  and  must  not  begin  with  <tt>\end</tt>; for
     <tt>\renewcommand</tt> it must already be defined. The 
     <tt>\providecommand</tt> command is identical to the <tt>\newcommand</tt>
     command if a command with this name does not exist; if it does
     already exist, the <tt>\providecommand</tt> does nothing and the
     old definition remains in effect.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><TT>args</TT> An integer from 1 to 9 denoting the number of arguments of
     the  command  being  defined.   The default is for the command to
     have no arguments.
<br>&nbsp;

<li><tt>opt</tt> (<strong><a href="versions.html">LaTeX2e only</a></strong>) 
     If present, then the first of the number of arguments specified by
     <tt>args</tt> is optional with a default value of <tt>opt</tt>;
     if absent, then all of the arguments are required. 
<br>&nbsp;

<li><TT>def</TT> The text to be substituted for every occurrence of  cmd;  a
     parameter  of  the  form #n in cmd is replaced by the text of the
     nth argument when this substitution takes place.
</ul>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p><tt>\newcommand{\water}{H$_2$O}</tt></p>

<p>This would allow one to write, e.g., </p>

<pre>
  The formula for water is \water. 
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre>
  \water\ is the formula for water.
</pre>

<p>Note, in the second case, the trailing <tt>\</tt> followed by a blank
is required to ensure a blank space after the H<sub>2</sub>O;
LaTeX ignores the blank following a command, so the space has
to be specifically inserted with the 
<a href="ltx-431.html"><tt>\&lt;space&gt;</tt></a>.</p>

<p>As a second example consider</p>

<p><tt>\newcommand{\hypotenuse}{$a^{2}+b^{2}$}</tt></p>

<p>
Note that this will produce the desired formula
in text (paragraph) mode because of the <tt>$...$</tt> in the definition.
In math mode, however, the first <tt>$</tt> 
in the definition will cause LaTeX to leave math mode, causing problems.</p>

<p>
In <strong>LaTeX 2.09</strong> a standard trick for getting around this is
to put the math-mode expression in an 
<a href="ltx-265.html"><tt>\mbox</tt></a>, viz.,</p>

<pre>
  <tt>\newcommand{\hypotenuse}{\mbox{$a^{2}+b^{2}$}}</tt>
</pre>

<p>
In <strong>LaTeX2e</strong> the 
<a href="ensuremath.html"><tt>\ensuremath</tt></a> command has been
provided to alleviate this problem.  The argument of the <tt>\ensuremath</tt>
command is always processed in math mode, regardless of the current mode. 
Using this mechanism the above could be written as </p>

<pre>
  <tt>\newcommand{\hypotenuse}{\ensuremath{a^{2}+y^{2}}}</tt>
</pre>
