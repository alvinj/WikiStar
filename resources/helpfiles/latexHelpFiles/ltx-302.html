<p>
 <tt>\raisebox{distance}[extend-above][extend-below]{text}</tt>
<p>

 The <tt>\raisebox</tt>  command  creates a LR box containing <tt>text</tt>;
 it is used  to raise  or lower  text.   The first
 mandatory  argument  specifies  how high the text is to be raised  (or
 lowered if it is a negative amount).  
<p>
 Sometimes  it's useful  to make LaTeX think something  has a different
 size than  it really  does  - or a different  size  than  LaTeX  would
 normally think it has.  The <tt>\raisebox</tt>  command lets you tell LaTeX how
 tall it is.
<p>
 The first optional argument, <tt>extend-above</tt>,  makes LaTeX think that the
 text  extends  above  the current line  by the amount  specified.   The second
 optional  argument, <tt>extend-below</tt>,  makes  LaTeX  think  that the text
 extends below the current line by the amount specified.
<p>
 <tt>\raisebox</tt> is <a href="fragile.html">fragile</a>.
