 Figures  are objects  that are not part  of the normal  text,  and are
 usually  "floated"  to a convenient  place,  like  the top  of a page.
 Figures will not be split between two pages.
<p>
 The optional argument [placement]  determines  where LaTeX will try to
 place your figure.  There are four places where LaTeX can possibly put
 a float:
<ul>
<li><TT>h</TT> Here  -  at  the  position  in  the  text  where  the  figure
     environment appears.
<li><TT>t</TT> Top - at the top of a text page.
<li><TT>b</TT> Bottom - at the bottom of a text page.
<li><TT>p</TT> Page of floats - on a separate float page, which  is  a  page
     containing no text, only floats.
</ul>
 The standard report and article styles use the default placement tbp.
<p>
 The body of the figure  is made up of whatever  text, LaTeX  commands,
 etc., you wish.  The 
 <a href="caption.html"><tt>\caption</tt></a>
  command allows you to title your figure.
