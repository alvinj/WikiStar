<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\cleardoublepage</h1>
<p>
 The <tt>\cleardoublepage</tt>  command  ends the current  page  and causes  all
 figures  and tables  that  have  so far appeared  in the  input  to be
 printed.  In a two-sided printing style, it also makes the next page a
 right-hand (odd-numbered) page, producing a blank page if necessary.
