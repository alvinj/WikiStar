</pre>
 The <tt>thebibliography</tt> environment produces a bibliography  or reference
 list.   In  the  article   style,  this  reference   list  is  labeled
 "References"; in the report style, it is labeled "Bibliography".
<p>
<TT>widest-label</TT> is text that, when printed, is approximately as  wide
     as the widest item label produced by the <tt>\bibitem</tt> command.
<p>
The <tt>thebibliography</tt> environment is similar to the 
<a href="ltx-222.html"><tt>enumerate</tt></a> environment, except that
items are associated with a <a href="ltx-205.html"><tt>\bibitem</tt></a>
command and can be cross-referenced with the 
<A href="ltx-211.html"><tt>\cite</tt></A> command.

<h2>An example</h2>
In the text you generate a reference to the bibliographic list as follows:
<pre>
  <tt>  ... In the running text you might want to refer to 
  Dow &amp; Jones\cite{DandJ} and then again you 
  might not ... </tt>
</pre>
The <A href="ltx-211.html"><tt>\cite</tt></a> 
command will produce  a sequence number by default, 
or the text from the optional <tt>label</tt> argument of 
<A href="ltx-205.html"><tt>\bibcite</tt></a>; this latter is useful
if the style is to use, for example, 
the first three letters of the author's last name and a year, as in  Dow29. 
<p> 
The associated item in the bibliography section at the end of the
article would be generated by
<pre>
  \begin{thebibliography}{99}
  ....
  \bibitem{DandJ} Dow, W. \& Jones, E.A.,
   {<a href="ltx-249.html">\it</a> Wall Street Journal},
   March 29, 1929.
  ....
  \end{thebibliography}
</pre>
Note that the <tt>widest-label</tt> parameter has been set assuming less than
100 numbered items in the bibliography.  Also note that the key, 
<tt>DandJ</tt>, is what connects the <A href="ltx-211.html"><tt>\cite</tt></A> 
and <A href="ltx-205.html"><tt>\bibitem</tt></A>.
<p>
If <tt>label</tt> is omitted, the numbers are generated sequentially by
the <A href="ltx-205.html"><tt>\bibitem</tt></A> commands.  Many journals
want these in order of appearance in the text, so you have to sort this
list to the proper order.
