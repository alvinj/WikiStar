<h3>Hypertext Help with LaTeX</h3><h1>\@</h1>
LaTeX normally leaves a little extra space after punctuation, such as the
period which ends a sentence.  However, it
uses a rather simple rule for determining whether a period ends a 
sentence: it assumes that periods end sentences <em>unless</em> they
follow an upper case letter. To tell LaTeX to insert extra space after
punctuation which follows an upper case letter, precede the punctuation
by   <tt>\@</tt>.
<p>
For example:
<pre>
  <tt>It is I\@.</tt>
</pre>
would not be considered to be a sentence by LaTeX except for the <tt>\@</tt>.
